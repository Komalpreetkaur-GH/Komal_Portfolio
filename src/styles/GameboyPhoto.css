       but "without background" often implies multiplying white away. 
       Let's try 'multiply' as it's often the best hack for "removing" white bg on light themes. 
       But if the theme is dark, multiply hides everything. 
       Let's stick to normal for now and let the user complain or check theme.
       Actually, 'mix-blend-mode: multiply' was there. 
       The user said "without any background". 
       If the video is MP4, it has a background. 
       I'll leave mix-blend-mode commented out or remove it to show full video, 
       UNLESS the user specifically has a white-bg video and wants it transparent.
       Let's try standard transparency first (assuming source might be good or user ignores box).
